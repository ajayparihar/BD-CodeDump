1. Review the codebase first to understand its structure and functionality.
2. Ask any clarifying questions necessary until you're 95% confident you fully understand the changes I've requested. Feel free to ask as many questions as needed.
3. Outline your approach before implementing any changes.
4. When implementing, provide clear explanations of what you're changing and why.
5. If you encounter multiple possible solutions, discuss the trade-offs before proceeding.
6. Consider potential edge cases or impacts on other parts of the codebase.
7. After implementation, summarize the changes made and any testing recommendations.
